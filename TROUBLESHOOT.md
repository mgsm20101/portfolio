# 🔧 Fixing GitHub Pages Deployment Issues

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` instead of complex method
   - Simplified deployment process
   - Added proper permissions

## 📋 Verification Steps:

### 1. Check GitHub Pages Settings

Open this link:
```
https://github.com/mgsm20101/portfolio/settings/pages
```

**Make sure:**
- ✅ **Source**: Deploy from a branch
- ✅ **Branch**: `gh-pages` / `(root)`
- ⚠️ If `gh-pages` branch doesn't appear, wait 1 minute and refresh

### 2. Monitor Deployment

Open Actions:
```
https://github.com/mgsm20101/portfolio/actions
```

- Wait for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" to complete ✅
- If failed, click on it to see the error

### 3. Open Website

After successful deployment:
```
🌐 https://mgsm20101.github.io/portfolio/
```

## 🔄 If Issues Persist:

### Alternative Solution: Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

Then in Settings → Pages:
- Select **Branch**: `gh-pages` / `(root)`
